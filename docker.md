## Docker images

The following Docker images on Dockerhub can be used for the assignments:

* Student image: harveymudd/cs159-student-pandoc:spring2021
* Autograder for lab 1: harveymudd/cs159-autograder-lab01:spring2021
* Autograder for lab 2: harveymudd/cs159-autograder-lab02:spring2021
* Autograder for lab 3: harveymudd/cs159-autograder-lab03:spring2021
* Autograder for lab 4: harveymudd/cs159-autograder-lab04:spring2021

If you are using Gradescope, you can directly use the autograder images for your grading. The docker image for students can be a helpful resource to ensure everyone has the correct versions of libraries installed. For information on getting started with Docker, you can look at the [HMC CS 159 course site](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/cs159spring2021/labs/docker-setup).

## Making your own Docker image

If you would like to modify the existing Docker images or autograders, please reach out to `xanda AT cs DOT hmc DOT edu` to gain access to the current files for these images. (These are not available publicly, as they containin autograders for some of the assignments.)
